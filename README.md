# Gitlab Search Highlighter
This was [jQueryInjector](https://github.com/attilathedud/jQueryInjector). And I tweaked a few lines to highlight keywords in Gitlab search project page.

# Usage
- `git clone` this repo.
- `cd` to the repo folder.
- Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome and set to *Developer mode*.
- Choose *LOAD UNPACKED* and select `./gitlabSearchHighlighter` in current repo folder.

# TODO
- [x] Highlight code
- [ ] Highlight multiple keywords
- [ ] Support Safari
